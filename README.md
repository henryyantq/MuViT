# MuViT
An adaptive musical vibrotactile system (MuViT). The paper will be updated later. Feel free to test the latest alpha version of the MuViT GUI-based Android application and modify the corresponding development file by using the popular online IDE, Kodular. 

Please note that MuViT works much better when responding to strongly rhythmic audio sources.

The architecture of MuViT is shown below:
